**Express-O The Automatic Drink Mixer!**

Express-O is a UWaterloo ME 101 Mechanical Engineering final design project.
This repository contains main program for robot drink mixer (in ROBOTC) and any supporting files that are required.
We used an ultrasonic sensor, and 6 motors, required a MotorMux to increase the outputs from the EV3 main module.
Collaborated with Tae Hwan Kim, Quinlan Kane, and Aidan Bilon.
